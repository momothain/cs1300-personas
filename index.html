            <p class="lead">The Multitudinuous Misdirection of Modern Machines, a short essay on valuing form over function</p>
            <p>For all customization options, there are exactly 4 LEDs, so on first look we expect there to be only 4 options each. This is not true. After some months living here, all three roommates realized there were hidden Temperature, Water Level options for the Washer. This is because when you cycle through the options, there is a 5th option where the LED is off, which some were initially confused by and others simply didn't notice for a while.
            </p> 
            <p>This 5th option is marked smaller and somewhat sideways of the initial customization options list with an open circle (which is likely supposed to indicate off). However, it's not part of the list, which makes it not seem like an option. Furthermore, it's not clear that it's supposed to occur on an off LED option. Two roommates felt almost antagonized by this, asking "why would they even do this?", or claiming it "deceivingly makes it seem very new. It doesn't make sense like our simple, old dryer."
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, none of the roommates realized there was actually a 6th "hidden option" marked by an asterisk and small text and placed completely below the whole list AND button! If you held the button for 3 seconds, which no one ever did in their normal use of the machines, you would trigger this extra option. If you held both buttons down for three secconds, marked by an "-*Child Lock-" between the two buttons with lines connecting it to each button, then you could engage the child lock. However, while Samsung deemed the open circle sufficient for describing an LED off state, they understood that this asterisk did nothing to indicate "hold for 3 seconds". Thus, at the very top of the selection area completely separate from the buttons or options lists, there is the "*(hold for 3 sec)". Everyone was astounded that there were these extra options and that they were indicated in this way. Again, the sentiment that Samsung was trying to look sleek and new and that they were sacrificing readability and ease of use of traditional washers/dryers. Especially after being interviewed, my roommates strongly felt that our old washers and dryers were designed much better and more honestly, as they list all of the relevant options on a single knob, let you select exact times, and directly see time elapsed.</p>
